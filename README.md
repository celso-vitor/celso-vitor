## üöÄ About Me

Hello! I'm Celso V√≠tor Calomeno, a passionate individual in the fields of **biotechnology** and **bioinformatics**, with a growing interest in new technologies and their innovative applications in biology and computing. I am always striving to improve my skills and learn new approaches to solve complex problems.

Currently, I am involved in a project on **digital image processing** to quantify plant stomata and participating in a **machine learning course** focused on biological data analysis. I am also exploring concepts in **interface languages** such as **HTML**, **CSS**, and **PHP** to complement my technical foundation.

Here‚Äôs some information about my work and interests:

- üî≠ **Currently working on**: Developing an algorithm to quantify plant stomata from digital microscopy images and enhancing my knowledge in **machine learning applied to biological data analysis**.
- üå± **Learning about**: Computer networks and reviewing concepts of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **PHP**.
- üëØ **Open to collaborating on**: Projects related to **biotechnology**, **bioinformatics**, and new challenges in the fields of **technology** and **biological data**.
